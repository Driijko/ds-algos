The two main types of list are arrays and linked-lists.

Arrays excel at constant time insertion and retrieval based on index.

Arrays can be fairly easily sorted.

Sorted arrays can be searched in logarithmic time.

An array-list implements stack functionality with the advantage of constant time retrieval based on index, but the disadvantage of limited growth (compared to linked lists).

Arrays are expensive to "grow" beyond their initial capacity. 

Arrays are inefficient for implementing a queue structure.

Linked lists excel at indefinite growth, specifically from the front or back of the list.

Linked lists can implement stack and queue functionality with constant time for all main operations.

Linked lists are not great for sorting or searching for data.


There are two types of lists: arrays and linked-lists.

Array advantages:
1.) Constant time retrieval based on index.
2.) Sorting.
3.) Logarithmic time searching of a sorted array.

Array disadvantages:
1.) Expensive to "grow" beyond initial capacity.

Linked-List advantages: 
1.) Easy to "grow" indefinitely.
2.) Constant time insertion at head and tail.

Linked-List disadvantages:
1.) Difficult to sort.
2.) Linear time searching.
